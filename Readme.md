1. Clone the repository:
   
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BikePricePredictor.git
cd BikePricePredictor

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

🧠 Training the Model
To train the model, run:
python train_model.py

This will:
Load the dataset (used_bike_data.csv)
Encode categorical columns
Train a Random Forest Regressor
Save the model and label encoder as bike_price_model.pkl and label_encoder.pkl

🌐 Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run app.py
Then open the local URL in your browser to use the app.
